        <p><strong>Myth 1: It’s not a real illness; it’s just a phase</strong><br><br>

        Depression is mostly identified as laziness; sadness; or even weakness of someone. Most people don’t look deeper into the mental illness and assume it’s normal since it’s mostly being “sad” all the time.<br><br>

        <strong>Reality: It is a real illness that affects oneself physically, mentally/emotionally, and socially.</strong><br><br>

        Confirmation from the World Health Organization, it is a real illness; it’s not a phase. Depression can affect people physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually. The mental disorder can cause our brain’s function, structure and chemistry to be heavily affected by biological and environmental factors.<br>

        As stated from the Ministry of Health, the symptoms of Depression are:<br></p>
        
      <ul>
    
      <li>Insomnia</li>
      <li>Malnutrition</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Poor concentration </li>
      <li>Overwhelming sadness and emptiness </li>
      <li>Constricted blood vessels (where blood vessels tend to narrow due to stress</li>
      <li>Risk of Cardiovascular disease and heart attack </li>
      </ul>
      
  
      <p>The term illness is defined as “a disease or sickness affecting the body or mind”; therefore, Depression can be classified as an illness since it affects one’s body and mind severely.<br><br></p>

      <p><strong>Myth 2: You can just “snap out of it”</strong><br><br>
      
      People generally believe that people with Depression tend to let themselves be depressed. They may think that a change of attitude and personality would help cure it, that positivity will cure the mental illness.<br><br>

      <strong>Reality: It’s a medical condition that causes the brain to function negatively</strong><br><br>
      
      Relating to the first reality, Depression is a medical condition which affects the brain and body. No one chooses to be depressed, nor do they deserve to be in that state.<br>

      Saying you can just “snap out of it” is like trying to get over a broken arm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of support to overcome Depression.<br><br> </p>
      </div><br>

      <div class="Main2">
      
      <p><strong>Myth 3: Depression is all about being sad</strong><br><br>
      
      A common “trend” which is happening in the community is that Depression is always being sad. This can lead to people thinking that if they are “sad”, they must have depression.<br><br>

      <strong>Reality: There is a difference between having Depression, and feeling depressed</strong><br><br>
      
      There is a major gap difference between Depression and sadness. Although sadness is a symptom of depression, usually people who are sad tend to just experience this emotion for a while. Then, circumstances changes and the feelings go away.<br><br>

      Depression, however, lasts a long time and consists of other negative symptoms. Episodes can usually range between a few days to weeks and maybe months.<br><br>

      Without a proper diagnose from a professional doctor, you cannot say you have depression. But if you have been experiencing the symptoms for long periods of time, then it might be good to check if you may have depression.<br></p>
