    <strong>What is Depression?</strong><br>
    </p>
      
      <p>According to the World Health Organization, Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression. It is a complex mental disorder which affects the human mind. The mental disorder can affect someone physically, emotionally/mentally, and socially, and have an impactful effect on someone’s daily life. <br><br>

      From the Ministry of Health in New Zealand, causes of depression vary, but possible factors are biological, psychological, and/or social sources of pressure, and could lead to changes in the brain’s function and behavior negatively. Pessimistic emotions and symptoms can last for weeks or even months.<br><br></p>

      Symptoms include: <br>

    <ul>
      <li>feeling tired all the time  </li>
      <li>getting too much sleep or not enough  </li>
      <li>feeling worthless and helpless</li>
      <li>thinking about death a lot </li>
      <li>having no energy and feelings of low self-esteem</li>
      <li>loss of appetite or overeating</li>
      <li>sadness or emotional ‘numbness’</li>
      <li>loss of pleasure in everyday activities </li>
      <li>irritability or anxiety</li>
      <li>poor concentration  </li>
      <li>feeling guilt or crying for no apparent reason.  </li>
      <li>Change in weight  </li>
    </ul>

    
    <p> A New Zealand Health survey was done in 2013, and it revealed that 14.3% of New Zealand adults had been diagnosed with Clinical Depression at some point in their lives. That is more than half a million people who had been struggling with this mental illness.</p>

      <strong>The Misunderstanding</strong><br>
    </p>
    
      <p>It’s difficult to cover the true meaning of the mental illness, so many people believe or spread beliefs and opinions of what Depression is.<br>

      One of the most debated beliefs is that “it is not a real illness; it’s just a phase”. Most people believe that this disorder is just a phase in life; that it’s just a mild issue in your head. <br>

      Depression can also be associated with the opinion that it’s just being sad/upset all the time, and you can “snap out of it”. It is more seen as emotional change rather than brain function, chemistry, and structure change.<br>
